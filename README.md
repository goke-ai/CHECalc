# CHECalc
Chemical Engineering Calculator.

(Please bear with my documentation skill, i prefer writing codes so this will not be very perfect. I will try though)

The idea of this project is to develop a Chemical Engineering Cross-Platform App using MAUI .Net Technology. It will allow me to learn MAUI better as well as provide something... a sort of mobile app for my student and Chemical Engineers.
Who knows I may discover something and it will turn to a gold mine.

### Skills i intend to improve include:
* MAUI
* Code Testing
* Class library (Code Refractoring)
* C# switch pattern
* README.md content development inside Visual Studio Solution Explorer
* Visual Studio use
* *


### Suggestions
* Visual studio team please integrate grammar and spell checker into this Markdown editor. It will save me alot of corrections.
* Please how about autocorrect and autocomplete

I didn't document well from Day 1 (Feb 8, 2024) so i will jump the documentation and start from today Thursday 15, February 2024 going forward. I will as well fillup the past days.

# Day 1

# Day 8
Feb 15, 2024

I was looking at some work i have done before and many have empty documentation. So I decided from today i will document whatever i will do, doing and done.

The first thing that hits me is, how do I import README.md into my project or solution explorer, so that i don't need to leave and edit somewhere else. 
I went to my Microsoft Edge (Edge) browser search for "visual studio 2022 how to edit README" and read "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/write-markdown-without-leaving-visual-studio/". 
The writeup was good but it didn't tell how to bring it into my solution explorer. Anyway I know how to Add New Project to Solution Explorer (SE) but will it allow me to Add an existing Item, and SE did!.
The rest is the begining of my documentation i hoped (Already I have spent almost 1hr setting up and writing "this" and no code yet! :) :| )

It is time I push this writeup as an update. 1hr of work is work.
