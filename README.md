# CHECalc
Chemical Engineering Calculator.

(Please bear with my documentation skill, i prefer writing codes so this will not be very perfect. I will try though)

The idea of this project is to develop a Chemical Engineering Cross-Platform App using MAUI .Net Technology. It will allow me to learn MAUI better as well as provide something... a sort of mobile app for my student and Chemical Engineers.
Who knows I may discover something and it will turn to a gold mine.

### Skills i intend to improve include:
* MAUI
* Code Testing
* Class library (Code Refractoring)
* C# switch pattern
* README.md content development inside Visual Studio Solution Explorer
* Visual Studio use
* Test Driven Development
* *


### Suggestions
* Visual studio team please integrate grammar and spell checker into this Markdown editor. It will save me alot of corrections.
* Please how about autocorrect and autocomplete
* *

I didn't document well from Day 1 (Feb 8, 2024) so i will jump the documentation and start from today Thursday 15, February 2024 going forward. I will as well fillup the past days.


Take note it is not that i work on it everyday.

# Day 1
Feb 8, 2024

I created the project and the solution in Visual Studion 2022 for Mac (VSMac). By the way I struggled Uploading the project to my Github account.

So I created my repo first on my github.com account with the README, then clone on my VSMac. After clonning I added the MAUI project.

Why?. I have registered for my Apple Developers account. So I can't connect to my Mac from my Windows VS. I have an old Mac but prefer developing on my Microsoft Surface Pro 8. So to test the features for Mac and iOS on my old Mac and Windows and Android on my Surface.

## Work

### Testing
- Add Numbers
- Add Point
- Add Operators

### Testing
- Add Negate
- Add Cancel
- Add Cancel Cancel

### Features
- Add Negate
- Add Cancel 
- Add Cancel Cancel



# Day 7
Feb 14, 2024
I decided to rewrite the testing of the existing features in the form i wrote CancelTest and CancelcancelTest.
Why? the test allowed the code to be self containg all the variable needed are passed as parameter. 

In fact most of the updates are done in the function.
## Work

### Testing
- Rewrite the Testing for Numbers
- Rewrite the Testing for Operators
- Rewrite the Testing for Point
- Rewrite the Testing for Negate



# Day 8
Feb 15, 2024

I was looking at some work i have done before and many have empty documentation. So I decided from today i will document whatever i will do, doing and done.

The first thing that hits me is, how do I import README.md into my project or solution explorer, so that i don't need to leave and edit somewhere else. 
I went to my Microsoft Edge (Edge) browser search for "visual studio 2022 how to edit README" and read "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/write-markdown-without-leaving-visual-studio/". 
The writeup was good but it didn't tell how to bring it into my solution explorer. Anyway I know how to Add New Project to Solution Explorer (SE) but will it allow me to Add an existing Item, and SE did!.
The rest is the begining of my documentation i hoped (Already I have spent almost 1hr setting up and writing "this" and no code yet! :) :| )

It is time I push this writeup as an update. 1hr of work is work.
